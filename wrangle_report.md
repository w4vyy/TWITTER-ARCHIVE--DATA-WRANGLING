Introduction:

The goal of this wrangling effort was to gather and prepare a dataset for further analysis. The data was collected from various sources, including online databases, APIs, and manual web scraping.

Data Gathering:

Initially, the data was gathered from a publicly available online database. However, this dataset was found to be incomplete and lacked some relevant information. Therefore, additional data was collected from other sources, including APIs and web scraping.

Data Assessing:

After collecting the data, I assessed its quality and tidiness. I identified several issues, including missing values, inconsistencies in the data, and incorrect data types.

Data Cleaning:

To address these issues, I performed several cleaning tasks, including:

Dropping rows with missing values
Fixing inconsistent data, such as wrongly formatted dates
Converting data to the correct type, such as converting strings to integers
Merging datasets to create a single, comprehensive dataset
Data Storing:

Finally, the cleaned and wrangled data was stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

Conclusion:

Overall, the wrangling process was successful in gathering and preparing the data for analysis. While there were some challenges, such as incomplete and inconsistent data, I was able to overcome them through various cleaning and preparation techniques. The resulting dataset is now ready for further analysis and insights.
