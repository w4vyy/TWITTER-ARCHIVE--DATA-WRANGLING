Introduction

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries,we gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. This is called data wrangling. we documented our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, and showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that we wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017



Context

The goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.



The Data

In this project, we worked on the following three datasets.

Enhanced Twitter Archive,
Image Predictions File,
Additional Data via the Twitter API,
