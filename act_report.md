Introduction:

Data is a powerful tool that can help us understand complex phenomena and make informed decisions. In this report, we explored the trends and patterns in the dataset that was collected and wrangled from various sources. We used visualization techniques to uncover insights and present them in an easy-to-understand manner.

Data Analysis:

After wrangling the data, we conducted an exploratory analysis both visually and programaticaly to understand the trends and patterns in the dataset. We first started by checking the total number of values in each columns, which helped us identify any outliers or anomalies. We then checked for the level of quality and tidiness of each column. This allowed us to see how clean the data was and what neded to be done.

Insights:

Through our analysis, we discovered several interesting insights. For example, we found that the distribution of the key variable was skewed to the right, indicating that most values were concentrated on the lower end of the scale. We also found that there was a strong seasonal trend, with a peak in the winter months and a trough in the summer months.

Visualizations:

To communicate these insights effectively, we created a series of visualizations. The first visualization shows the popularity amongst the dog breeds, the second visualization shows the popularity amongst the dog tyepes, while the third visualization presents the rate of increase and decrease of tweets over a specific period of time . These plots reveal the trends and patterns in the data, making it easier to understand the underlying phenomena.These plots are hown below.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, our analysis and visualization of the dataset provided valuable insights into the trends and patterns in the data. These insights can be used to inform decision-making and better understand the underlying phenomena. We hope that these visualizations will help others to easily understand and interpret the data as well.
